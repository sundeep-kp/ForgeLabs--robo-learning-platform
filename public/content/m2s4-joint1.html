        <h2>Build Joint 1 (1-DOF Prototype)</h2>
    </header>

    <section>
        <p>A robotic arm is a series of mechanical joints. We will prototype the first joint, often called the **base or waist joint**, which provides a single degree of freedom (1-DOF) crucial for horizontal rotation.</p>
        
        <h3>Diagram: Base Joint Assembly</h3>
        <p>This joint uses a heavy-duty servo (like an MG996R) connected to a 3D-printed or laser-cut base and turntable.</p>

        <h3>🧠 Section 1 — Core Concept: Degree of Freedom (DOF)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>**1-DOF:** The base joint controls rotation around a single axis (vertical).</li>
            <li>A robotic arm's dexterity depends directly on its total DOF (typically 4 to 6 for industrial arms).</li>
            <li>To simplify control, we mount the servo vertically and attach the turntable directly to the output shaft.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>🔧 Section 2 — Hands-On: Assembly Steps</h3>
        <p>Ensure all screws are tight to minimize backlash (unwanted movement/slop in the gears).</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Secure the servo motor vertically to the **base plate**.</li>
            <li>Attach the **turntable** (the part that rotates) to the servo horn using the supplied screws.</li>
            <li>Wire the servo signal to **Pin 10** for testing.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>💻 Section 3 — Arduino Code Example (Sweep Test)</h3>
        <p>Test the joint's limits. Ensure the mechanical assembly does not bind or stall the motor at its programmed extremes.</p>
        <pre><code>
#include &lt;Servo.h&gt;
Servo baseJoint;

void setup() {
  baseJoint.attach(10); 
  baseJoint.write(90); // Start centered
  delay(500);
}

void loop() {
  // Rotate slowly from 0 to 180
  for (int angle = 0; angle <= 180; angle += 1) {
    baseJoint.write(angle);
    delay(10); 
  }
  delay(1000);
  
  // Rotate back slowly
  for (int angle = 180; angle >= 0; angle -= 1) {
    baseJoint.write(angle);
    delay(10);
  }
  delay(1000);
}

        <h3>🎯 Mini-Task: Measuring Backlash</h3>
        <p>Power the servo, manually push the turntable, and see how far it moves before the servo resists. This movement is **backlash**.</p>
