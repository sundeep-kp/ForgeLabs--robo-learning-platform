<!-- Lesson: Build a 2-DOF Arm -->
<h1>Module 3, Session 4: Build a 2-DOF Arm</h1>
<h2>What You'll Learn</h2>
<p>This session guides you through building a simple 2-degree-of-freedom robotic arm using servos and basic materials.</p>
<h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Gather materials: two servos, base, arm segments, screws.</li>
  <li>Assemble the base and attach the first servo for rotation.</li>
  <li>Mount the second servo for the elbow joint.</li>
  <li>Wire both servos to Arduino and test movement.</li>
</ol>
